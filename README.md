# How to set this up in two simple steps:
First, clone this repo to the server you want to run it on.
Second, run chmod +x ./setup.sh ; ./setup.sh

That's it! (there are more instructions when you run the setup script)

If you don't have a server to run this on you can setup a free forever oracle vm. Here's [a nice article](https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/post/how-to-set-up-and-run-a-really-powerful-free-minecraft-server-in-the-cloud) I found a while ago that walks you through the process. (Ignore anything Minecraft related but everything else is great!)

If you have any questions feel free to message me :)
